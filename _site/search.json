    "section": "Professional Journey",
    "text": "Professional Journey\nMy inspiration for pursuing Analytics stemmed from my previous role as a Media Planner, I had opportunity with our Marketing Science team to work on a geo-lift experiment for a client and I was able to analyze the historical data and identify the control cities as well as test group and once the experiment was successful, I was given the opportunity to present and that moment made me realize this comes naturally to me and I want to pursue this. I was promoted to Media Planning Manager and requested to have analytic responsibilities as well. From there on, I felt the industry was constantly evolving and I need to keep up with it so I decided to pursue Masters in Business Analytics at Boston University.\nAfter completing the course, I feel like I have a better understanding of the full marketing execution workflow all the way upto analysis of campaign performance and reporting. Most importantly I am not afraid to challenge myself to learn new tools and techniques that can be used in Marketing Measurement frameworks. I have also had opportunity to work hands-on with healthcare data and there I am most interested in analyzing patient data for resource allocation, identifying trends/patterns of symptoms for a particular disease and even claims data to recommend ways of streamlining the process more efficiently. Over the period of last 1.5 years I have worked with classmates, teammembers on hackathons, professors on exploring advanced topics while preparing for job applications and what I have realized is that I have developed a practice of using AI to execute my logic and completely depend on my learning and understanding for figuring out how to solve business problems by using the data at hand. I have been constantly practicing converting business problems into analytic questions for the data so my query and code writing becomes easy.\nApart from practicing proficiency in usual analytical tools and techniques like Python, R, SQL and BI platforms like Power BI, Excel and Tableau, I am willing to learn tools that an organization requires, document processes and constantly work on improving my ability to communicate learnings from the data analysis in the most simple way so that coming to conclusions & business decisions is easier for stakeholders and decision makers."
